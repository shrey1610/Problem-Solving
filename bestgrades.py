"""Andrew has a string consisting of lowercase English letters representing respective grades of to
students in his class. His grade is at Pth index. He can swap any two adjacent grades
â€¢ Your task is to help Andrew find and return a string value, representing maximized grade by
bringing lexicographically smallest character on the Pth index after doing at most K swaps
Sample Input:
abcdefg
3
