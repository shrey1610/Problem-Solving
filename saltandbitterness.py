# quaint village in possible max bitterness level problem (straight approach)
"""In a quaint village nestled between rolling hills, there were N different salt containers and N
different pepper containers in two separate groups. Each container had a specific level of bitterness,
represented by arrays A and B respectively. The task at hand was to form N combinations, each
consisting of one salt container and one pepper container
â€¢ However, there was a twist to the challenge. The objective was to arrange the combinations in
such a way that the maximum bitterness level, which is the sum of salt and pepper quantities in
each combination, was minimized. Print the lowest possible maximum bitterness level.
Input Format:
The first line contains a single integer N, the number of salt and pepper containers in each group.
The second line contains N space-separated integers, denoting the bitterness level of N salt
containers.
The third line contains N space-separated integers, denoting the bitterness level of N pepper
containers.
Sample Input:

2 8 6
Output:
