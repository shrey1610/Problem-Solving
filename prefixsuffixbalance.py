"""You are given an array A of N integers. The array A can be divided into two parts: the first part
consists of the first 'l' elements of A (where ranges from 1 to N), and the second part consists of the
last (N-i) elements of A
â€¢ Your task is to find and return a new array named result of the same size as A, where each
element of result[i] represents the absolute difference between the sum of the elements in the first
part of A and the sum of the elements in the second part of A
Note: For i= N,N-i=0.So, consider the sum of last N-i integers as O in this case
Input Specifications:
input1: An integer value representing the size of the array A.
Input2: An integer array A.
Output Specification:
Return a new integer array named result of the same size as A, where each element of result(i)
represents the absolute difference between the sum of the elements in the first part A and the sum of
the elements in the second part of A
Sample Input:
5
1 2 3 4 5
Sample Output:
 [13, 9, 3, 5, 15]
